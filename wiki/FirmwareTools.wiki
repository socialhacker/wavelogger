The build system provides a lot of functionality.  The following are some of the commands that can be used in the CPUDisc and PowerDisc directories.

  * `gmake`
    This builds the firmware in its default release mode.

  * `gmake debug`
    This builds the firmware in its debug mode.  This adds size to the resulting firmware
    but it makes it much more debuggable.

  * `gmake write`
    This builds and writes the firmware to the device using an AVRISPMKII in circuit 
    programmer.  The main CPU board has a six pin header.  The power supply board requires
    either a custom adapter, or individual test clamps for each signal.

  * `gmake write debug`
    This is the same as write, but it writes a debug version of the firmware.

  * `gmake write_fuses`
    This writes the fuse values from the firmware to the device fuses.  This is needed to
    correctly configure the device, but is only needed once, unless the fuses change 
    during development.

  * `gmake show_fuses`
    This shows the current state of the fuses.  It can be useful to to verify that 
    write_fuses performed correctly.
